departmental stores, bus stops, etc. for the user. The project focuses on
blind people providing an easy to access user interface allowing its user to directly operate

 Navigating till the destination: The voice guided navigation system will facilitate
the end user to navigate to the desired place and will notify them on upcoming turns,
circles, etc. with a precise distance.
 Voice Input: This feature will enable blind people to provide desired destination by
the voice guided input.
 Smart app gestures: This feature will enable the user to launch the app through
some gestures (like wave, sliding up, double tap) on home screen itself.
